# Android App Automation Testing with Appium and WebdriverIO

This project demonstrates how to automate the testing of an Android application using **Appium** and **WebdriverIO** with **JavaScript**. The tests include logging in with both valid and invalid credentials in the mobile application and verifying the correct behavior of the app.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later) – [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** – [Install JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **Android Studio** with **Android SDK** – [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- **Appium** – [Install Appium](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/)
- **WebdriverIO** – [WebdriverIO Documentation](https://webdriver.io/)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd android-appium-tests
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure that you have **Appium** installed globally or locally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g appium
   ```

4. Set up an **Android Emulator** or connect a **real Android device** with **USB debugging enabled**.

5. Make sure **Appium** can access the app under test (e.g., `.apk` file). The app will be installed onto the emulator or connected device.

## Running Tests

Once everything is set up, you can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
```

This will run all the tests defined in your `wdio.conf.js` configuration file.

### Example Test Cases

1. **Invalid Login Test**: The first test case checks that an invalid login attempt shows an appropriate error message, such as:
   ```text
   "Username and password do not match any user in this service."
   ```

2. **Valid Login Test**: The second test case verifies that a valid login displays the `PRODUCTS` screen, as expected in the Swag Labs app.

## Test File Structure

Your tests are written in **Mocha** and run with **WebdriverIO**. The tests are located in the `test/specs/` directory.

- **`e2e.js`**: Contains the test cases for invalid and valid login scenarios.

Here’s an example of a test:

```javascript
describe('Android App Test', () => {
  it('should not login with invalid credentials', async () => {
    await $('~test-Username').setValue("wrongUser");
    await $('~test-Password').setValue("wrongPassword");
    await $('~test-LOGIN').click();
    await expect($('//android.widget.TextView[@text="Username and password do not match any user in this service."]')).toBeDisplayed();
  });

  it('should login with valid credentials', async () => {
    await $('~test-Username').setValue("standard_user");
    await $('~test-Password').setValue("secret_sauce");
    await $('~test-LOGIN').click();
    await expect($('//android.widget.TextView[@text="PRODUCTS"]')).toBeDisplayed();
  });
});
```

## Configuration

Your WebDriverIO configuration file is located at `wdio.conf.js`. You can modify capabilities, log levels, and other settings within this configuration file as per your requirements.

Ensure that you define the correct `appPackage` and `appActivity` for your app in the `wdio.conf.js` capabilities section.

## Troubleshooting

- **Emulator not starting**: Make sure that the emulator is properly configured with the required API level and that it's running before starting the tests.

- **Appium server issues**: Ensure that the Appium server is running on the correct port (`4723` by default) and is properly connected to your Android device.

- **Locator issues**: Use Appium Inspector to inspect the elements of the app and ensure your locators are correct.
